                Premium is on the way, with new big features planned!
                The price is going to be pretty cheap, most likely a one time payment of $5.
                And no, don't worry, no features from the existing free version will be restricted or taken away. New features only!
                <br /> <br />
                Be sure to check out this page once premium has released!
